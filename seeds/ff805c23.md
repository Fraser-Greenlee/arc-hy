# Concepts
rotational symmetry, overlap

# Description
In the input you will see a large pattern with rotational symmetry, rects with only overlap colors are over the pattern placed with rotational symmetry. There is one small rect with a solid color covering part of the grid. The background is black.
To make the output, render the covered part of the grid, do this by shufting the original grid by the solid rect's position and remove the solid rect from the grid code.
