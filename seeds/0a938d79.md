# Concepts

repetition, horizontal/vertical bars

# Description

The input defines a pair of colored pixels
Make each pixel into a horizontal/vertical bar by connecting it to the other (longer) side of the canvas
Then, repeat the bars indefinitely in the same direction: either downward (for horizontal bars) or rightward (for vertical bars)

## To Output Function

```python

    c1, c2 = draw1[2][1], draw2[2][1]
    p1, p2 = draw1[1], draw2[1]

    # determine line delta based on grid dimensions
    line_delta = [grid_h - 1, 0] if grid_w > grid_h else [0, grid_w - 1]

    # get starting positions for repeating pattern
    r1_start = hy_eval(p1)[grid_w > grid_h]
    r2_start = hy_eval(p2)[grid_w > grid_h]

    # Determine pattern repeat length
    r_end = grid_w if grid_w > grid_h else grid_h

    # Calculate distance between points for spacing
    p_delta = (hy_eval(p1) - hy_eval(p2)).abs()

    # Step size is twice the delta between points
    r_step = int(p_delta[int(grid_w > grid_h)]) * 2

    # Template for iteration coordinates
    it_template = "[0, it]" if grid_w > grid_h else "[it, 0]"
